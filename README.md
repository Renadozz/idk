Requirements

- Use the `Scanner` class for input.
- Provide a `Calculator` class with the calculation logic separated from `Main`.
- The input may look like: `30 + 10 * 5 / (2 - 1)` and should be calculated correctly using operator precedence and parentheses.
- Validate input with a regular expression using `java.util.regex.Pattern`.
- Do not use external libraries.
- Accept input with or without whitespace.
- Handle edge cases and provide useful custom exceptions for invalid input.
- The program should run until the user types `exit`.
